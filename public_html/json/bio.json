	"bio": "Student by day, polymath by night. I enjoy programming, gaming, building computers, modding computers, and much more. I'm a very DIY type of guy, and I take pride in my work. When I work, I take time to layout the overall ground plan before getting into it. A well laid foundation can lead to less headaches in the future. Sustainable, scalable, and efficient solutions are the type that I aim to create."
